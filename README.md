# OpenClaw on Agent Substrate

Run OpenClaw personal-AI-assistant instances on GKE with [Agent Substrate](https://github.com/agent-substrate/substrate),
minimizing compute cost. OpenClaw agents are idle >95% of the time but must appear
online 24/7 for channels like WhatsApp. We resolve that by **splitting presence
from cognition**: an always-on gateway holds the channel connections, while the
expensive agent runs as a suspendable Substrate actor. The gateway suspends it
once the conversation goes idle, and the next message auto-resumes it on demand.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design and tradeoffs (with diagrams),
and [Measured latency](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#measured-latency) for what activation
actually costs and which bracket each number belongs to.

## Demo

[![OpenClaw on Agent Substrate: always-on agents, suspended when idle](docs/always-on-agents-demo-poster.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5a9tyPkaPY)

Two minutes, with narration. A WhatsApp message wakes an agent that is not
running, it answers from restored conversation state, checkpoints itself once the
conversation goes quiet, and then ten agents cycle through five machines while the
control plane is queried alongside.

## How it integrates

### A drop-in plugin: zero edits to existing OpenClaw files
Everything lives in `extensions/substrate/`. Copy it into OpenClaw's `extensions/`
and enable it in `openclaw.json`. Config is declared in the plugin manifest
(`openclaw.plugin.json` → `configSchema`) and startup wiring runs through
OpenClaw's plugin service + hook API, so **no core OpenClaw file is modified**:
no changes to config types, Zod schema, `server.impl.ts`, channels, agents, or
skills.

```bash
cp -r extensions/substrate <openclaw>/extensions/substrate
# or bundle into the image:  docker build --build-arg OPENCLAW_EXTENSIONS=substrate ...
```

Then set `plugins.entries.substrate` in config (see `extensions/substrate/README.md`).

The same logic can be wired straight into an OpenClaw build instead, as a
`src/substrate/` module plus about 30 lines of config and startup plumbing. That
was the original shape here and the plugin supersedes it, so it is not in this
repo.

## Repo layout

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `extensions/substrate/` | The drop-in OpenClaw plugin (manifest, ACP backend, actor provisioner, idle suspender) |
| `manifests/` | Substrate + gateway K8s resources (WorkerPool, ActorTemplate, gateway, ingress) |
| `build/` | Image build: gateway/actor Dockerfiles, Cloud Build configs, actor image inputs (`build/actor/`) |
| `demo/` | WhatsApp demo config + deploy script + live dashboard |
| [`docs/`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Architecture doc + diagrams |

## Quick start (demo)

1. Install Substrate on a GKE cluster from a Substrate checkout with
   `hack/install-ate.sh --deploy-ate-system`. Create the cluster with the
   PodCertificate beta APIs enabled, and set up the snapshot bucket and its IAM
   first; see [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md) Step 1. (The packaged installer
   at [`ai-on-gke/substrate-gke`](https://github.com/ai-on-gke/substrate-gke) does
   all of that for you, but its pre-built image track is not usable yet.)
2. `export PROJECT_ID=… GCS_BUCKET=… GEMINI_API_KEY=…`
3. `cd demo && ./deploy-demo.sh` builds the images, pins them by digest, deploys
   the WorkerPool, ActorTemplate, and gateway, then prints next steps (link
   WhatsApp, send a message). See [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md) for the full
   walkthrough.

## For a harness company adopting this

- **Copy `extensions/substrate/`** into your OpenClaw tree (or bundle via
  `OPENCLAW_EXTENSIONS`). No other OpenClaw code changes.
- **Config only, per deployment**: set `plugins.entries.substrate` on the gateway
  (atespace, golden template, actor token, idle timeout) and ACP bindings in
  `openclaw.json`. The actor image runs stock OpenClaw with no plugin.
- **On the Substrate side** (targets current OSS `agent-substrate/substrate`,
  CRD group `ate.dev`): apply the `WorkerPool` + `ActorTemplate` manifests
  (`ate.dev/v1alpha1`), point the gVisor `SandboxConfig` at a runsc build that
  survives a heavy multi-process Node.js actor, and apply the control-plane
  changes below. Actors use the **atespace** model
  (`kubectl ate create atespace <a>; kubectl ate create actor <n> -a <a> --template-ref <name>`,
  `--template` on Substrate main) and are reached through the atenet router, addressed
  by Host `<actor>.<atespace>.actors.resources.substrate.ate.dev` on release-0.1 and by
  the `ate-target-actor: <atespace>/<actor>` header on main. The gateway sends both.

### Substrate configuration this needs

It runs on stock Substrate. Earlier revisions of this file listed six
control-plane patches as prerequisites, and that list is obsolete. The cluster
behind [Measured latency](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#measured-latency) runs `v0.1.0`
images for `atecontroller`, `atelet`, `ateom-gvisor` and `atenet` with no source
changes, the `gvisor-default` `SandboxConfig` exactly as the installer ships it,
and the default 20s golden warmup. No pinned runsc.

Two of the retired claims were wrong rather than merely stale, and
[`substrate-patches/README.md`](substrate-patches/README.md) records them so they
do not get repeated: a GKE-Sandbox `runsc` build is **not** required, and the
`ATE_*` environment knobs it described never existed upstream.

What is left is operator tuning. Both of these are `atenet-router` flags whose
defaults are low for an LLM harness:

| Flag | Default | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| `--route-timeout` | 10s | Bounds one request from the ingress listener to the actor's response. The gateway relays an entire LLM completion over that request, so a turn longer than the default is cut off. |
| `--parked-request-budget` | 5s | Bounds how long a request waits for its actor to resume. Resume is 3.4s P50 here, so the default leaves little headroom on a cold node or a larger snapshot. |

Because the plugin integrates *below* the framework via OpenClaw's own ACP
protocol and plugin API, community-maintained channels/agents/skills, including
future ones, work unmodified.
